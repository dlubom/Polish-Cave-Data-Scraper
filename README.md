# Polish-Cave-Data-Scraper

## Overview

**Polish-Cave-Data-Scraper** is a robust Python-based tool designed to scrape and collect comprehensive data on Polish caves from the **Central Geological Database of Polish Caves (CBDG)** managed by the **Polish Society for Friends of Earth Sciences (PTPNoZ)**. The scraper gathers standardized information, including geolocation, morphology, environmental data, historical descriptions, and graphic attachments such as plans, sections, and photographs. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, conservationists, and speleologists interested in the geological and environmental aspects of Polish caves.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. First, ensure you have Poetry installed on your system. If not, install it using:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polish-cave-data-scraper.git
   cd polish-cave-data-scraper
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Creating a Clean Environment

To ensure a clean environment for the project:

1. Remove any existing virtual environment (if present):
   ```bash
   poetry env remove python
   ```

2. Clear Poetry's cache (optional):
   ```bash
   poetry cache clear . --all
   ```

3. Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

The scraper consists of two main scripts that should be run in sequence:

1. First, run the data fetching script:
   ```bash
   poetry run python fetch.py
   ```
   This script collects raw data from the CBDG database.

2. Then, run the parsing script:
   ```bash
   poetry run python parse.py
   ```
   This script processes the collected data into a structured format.
